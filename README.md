ChronoCalc is a GUI-based day calculator built with Python and Tkinter.  
It applies concepts of modular arithmetic and discrete mathematics to determine weekdays efficiently.  

âœ¨ Features:
- Enter a large integer to compute the resulting weekday after that many days.
- Enter a base and power to calculate (base^power) mod 7 and map it to a weekday.
- Handles extremely large numbers using custom modular reduction and fast exponentiation.
- Dark-themed user interface with error handling for smooth experience.
